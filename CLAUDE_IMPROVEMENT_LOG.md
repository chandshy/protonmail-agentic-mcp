# Claude Auto-Improvement Log

This file records every autonomous improvement cycle run on this codebase.

---

## Cycle #17
**Timestamp:** 2026-03-18 04:25–04:40 Eastern
**Git commit:** `f6ed4b1`
**Branch:** main
**Model:** claude-sonnet-4-6

### Audit Highlights

**MCP Prompts section incomplete in README:**
The `ListPromptsRequestSchema` handler in `src/index.ts` registers 5 prompts: `triage_inbox`, `compose_reply`, `daily_briefing`, `find_subscriptions`, `thread_summary`. The README "MCP Prompts" subsection listed only 3 (`compose_reply`, `thread_summary`, `find_subscriptions`) — `triage_inbox` and `daily_briefing` were absent. This was flagged as a new finding in Cycle #16's LAST_AUDIT_SUMMARY.

**Stale "40 tools" in settings server embedded HTML:**
`src/settings/server.ts` contained two occurrences of "40 tools" in the Full Access preset description — once in the preset comparison table (line 714) and once in the setup wizard (line 946). The README was corrected to 47 in Cycle #16, but the embedded HTML was not checked at that time.

**Security sweep — all clear:**
- `POST /api/config`: ports validated as integers 1–65535, hosts validated (non-empty, ≤253 chars, no control chars/whitespace), preset validated against allowlist. No gaps.
- `POST /api/preset`: validated against `["full","read_only","supervised","send_only","custom"]` allowlist.
- `POST /api/test-connection`: ports, hosts, SSRF host allowlist all enforced.
- `POST /api/escalations/:id/approve`: 4-layer gate intact (rate limit + CSRF + Origin + `body.confirm === "APPROVE"`).
- `approveEscalation()` expiry check: `Date.now() > new Date(e.expiresAt).getTime()` — confirmed intact (line 394).
- `evictExpired()`: pending escalations auto-expire on read. Confirmed working.
- General rate limiter (120/min) wraps all routes. Escalation-specific limiter (20/min) wraps approve/deny. Both confirmed.
- TUI (`src/settings/tui.ts`): no prompts references, no security concerns.

### Work Completed This Cycle

1. **README — MCP Prompts table expanded** (`README.md`)
   - Replaced bare 3-item bullet list with a 5-row markdown table.
   - Added `triage_inbox` (with `limit` and `focus` arguments) and `daily_briefing` (no arguments).
   - All 5 registered prompts now documented with their arguments.

2. **Settings UI — "40 tools" corrected to "47 tools"** (`src/settings/server.ts`)
   - Line 714: preset comparison table Full Access description.
   - Line 946: setup wizard Full Access preset card description.
   - Both now match the correct count of 47, consistent with README (fixed Cycle #16) and CHANGELOG.

### Validation Results

- Build: clean (`tsc` no errors)
- Tests: **416/416 pass** (unchanged — doc-only change for README; string-only change for server.ts HTML)

---

## Cycle #16
**Timestamp:** 2026-03-18 04:05–04:20 Eastern
**Git commit:** `be30584`
**Branch:** main
**Model:** claude-sonnet-4-6

### Audit Highlights

**Tool count discrepancy discovered:**
The README tagline claimed "45 tools" and the Full Access preset description said "All 45 tools". Examination of the actual `server.tool()` registrations in `src/index.ts` (lines 292–1324) revealed **47 tools**. The CHANGELOG [2.1.0] also incorrectly stated "5 new tools (45 total)". All three occurrences were corrected to 47.

The discrepancy appears to have existed since before any autonomous cycles — the original codebase already had 47 tools, but the CHANGELOG and README were written assuming the original pre-security-hardening count of 45 without accounting for `bulk_delete` (alias) and `forward_email` which were both present from the start.

**`imap.healthy` not mentioned in README:**
As flagged in Cycle #15 LAST_AUDIT_SUMMARY: the `get_connection_status` tool description in the README table only said "SMTP/IMAP connection health, config path, settings status". The tool actually returns `imap.healthy` (live NOOP probe result from Cycle #14) and `insecureTls` flags for both SMTP and IMAP. The description was updated to mention these fields.

**CHANGELOG missing cycles 1–15 work:**
CHANGELOG only had version-tagged releases. A new `[Unreleased]` section was added documenting all security hardening, type safety improvements, DRY refactoring, and test coverage additions from Cycles #1–#15.

**5 MCP Prompts confirmed separate from tools:**
Lines 2324–2359 in `src/index.ts` contain 5 MCP prompts (`triage_inbox`, `compose_reply`, `daily_briefing`, `find_subscriptions`, `thread_summary`) registered separately from tools. The README correctly does not count these as tools.

### Work Completed This Cycle

1. **README tagline** — "45 tools" → "47 tools"
2. **README Full Access preset** — "All 45 tools" → "All 47 tools"
3. **README `get_connection_status` description** — extended to mention `imap.healthy` (NOOP probe) and `insecureTls` flags
4. **CHANGELOG [2.1.0]** — "5 new tools (45 total)" → "5 new tools (47 total)"
5. **CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]` section added** — comprehensive entry covering all security, type safety, and DRY improvements from Cycles #1–#15

### Validation Results

- Build: clean (`tsc` exit 0)
- Tests: **416 passed**, 0 failed (14 test files)

---

## Cycle #15
**Timestamp:** 2026-03-18 03:50–04:00 Eastern
**Git commit:** `14830d5`
**Branch:** main
**Model:** claude-sonnet-4-6

### Audit Highlights

**Phase 1 — `save_draft` / `schedule_email` / `send_email` attachment shape validation (Item #30):**
All three handlers passed `args.attachments as EmailAttachment[] | undefined` directly to the service layer without any handler-level shape validation. If a caller supplied `attachments: ["string"]` or `attachments: [{filename: 123, content: null}]`, the error would surface deep inside nodemailer/mailcomposer with a confusing stack trace. The service layer sanitizes MIME fields (CRLF stripping, contentType regex) but assumes the array items are already objects with string filename and Buffer/string content.

**Phase 2 — Broader survey:**
- Zero avoidable `as any` casts remain (confirmed from Cycles #10–#12).
- All catch blocks log errors; none silently swallow. Scheduler catch blocks increment retryCount and log at warn/error.
- No O(n²) patterns found in production paths.
- Test count was 393; after Cycle #15 additions it is 416.

### Work Completed This Cycle

1. **`validateAttachments()` helper added to `src/utils/helpers.ts`**
   - Validates that `attachments` is `undefined`, `null`, or a non-empty array of objects.
   - Each item must have: `filename` (non-empty string), `content` (string or Buffer), `contentType` (string if present).
   - Returns `null` on success or an error message string with the offending index (e.g. `attachments[1].content must be a base64 string or Buffer.`).
   - Exported alongside other validators.

2. **`validateAttachments` wired into all three handler sites in `src/index.ts`:**
   - `send_email`: `seAttErr = validateAttachments(args.attachments)` → throw `McpError(InvalidParams)` on failure.
   - `save_draft`: `sdAttErr = validateAttachments(args.attachments)` → same.
   - `schedule_email`: `schAttErr = validateAttachments(args.attachments)` → same (placed before `send_at` checks for early rejection).

3. **23 new unit tests in `src/utils/helpers.test.ts`:**
   - null/undefined (omitted) — valid.
   - Empty array — valid.
   - Non-array input (object, string, number) — error.
   - Valid single and multi-attachment arrays (string content, Buffer content, no contentType).
   - Primitive items in array (string, null, number) — error with index.
   - Missing/empty/wrong-type filename — error.
   - Missing/null/wrong-type content — error.
   - Wrong-type contentType — error.
   - Correct index reported for second malformed item.

### Validation Results
- Build: clean (0 TypeScript errors)
- Tests: **416 passed** (was 393 before this cycle; +23)

### Git Status
- Committed: `14830d5`
- Pushed to: `origin/main`

### Next Cycle Focus
- Item #31: `ensureConnection()` friendly error wrapping (low priority — assessed twice; skip unless usability complaint surfaces).
- README accuracy audit — verify all 45 tools documented and descriptions match current behavior (e.g. `get_connection_status` now returns `imap.healthy`, added in Cycle #14).
- Consider: any high-value JSDoc gaps in public helpers (none critical, but `validateAttachments` was just added and is fully documented inline).

---

## Cycle #14
**Timestamp:** 2026-03-18 03:35–03:45 Eastern
**Git commit:** `c636c50`
**Branch:** main
**Model:** claude-sonnet-4-6

### Audit Highlights

**Phase 1 — `move_to_label` / `bulk_move_to_label` inline validation:**
Both handlers had 3 consecutive inline if-blocks (empty check, control-char/slash/traversal check, length check) instead of calling the `validateLabelName()` helper that already existed in `helpers.ts` and was already used in the `get_emails_by_label` handler. Confirmed `validateLabelName` was already imported in `src/index.ts` at line 30.

**Phase 2 — `get_connection_status` missing healthCheck:**
Handler at line 2147 returned `imap.connected: imapService.isActive()` (flag-only check) but did not call `healthCheck()`. The method was added in Cycle #13 but left unwired. Adding `imapHealthy: await imapService.healthCheck()` surfaces the NOOP round-trip probe to agents using the tool.

**Phase 3 — `ensureConnection()` error message clarity:**
Assessed: `ensureConnection()` calls `reconnect()` which calls `connect()`. The `connect()` method logs the error with context via `logger.error(...)` and re-throws the original. The warning "IMAP connection lost, attempting to reconnect" is printed before the attempt. Error messages are reasonably clear — skipped this cycle as instructed.

### Work Completed This Cycle

1. **`move_to_label` — replaced 9 lines of inline validation with 2-line helper call**
   - Removed 3 if-blocks; replaced with `const mtlValidErr = validateLabelName(label)` + throw guard.
   - Behavior is identical — `validateLabelName()` implements the same rules.

2. **`bulk_move_to_label` — replaced 9 lines of inline validation with 2-line helper call**
   - Same pattern: `const bmlValidErr = validateLabelName(rawLabel)` + throw guard.
   - Net removal: ~14 lines from `src/index.ts`.

3. **`get_connection_status` — wired `healthCheck()` into response**
   - Added `healthy: await imapService.healthCheck()` to the `imap` sub-object.
   - Updated `outputSchema` to declare `healthy: { type: "boolean" }` in the `imap` properties.
   - `healthCheck()` sends NOOP to the server; returns `false` silently if disconnected or if NOOP fails. Never throws.

### Validation Results
- Build: clean (0 TypeScript errors)
- Tests: **393 passed, 0 failed** (identical count to Cycle #13 — no new tests needed; existing tests for `validateLabelName` cover all branches; `healthCheck` tested in Cycle #13)

### Git Status
- Committed: `c636c50` — `src/index.ts` only (+10 / -21 lines)
- Pushed to: `origin/main`

---

## Cycle #1
**Timestamp:** 2026-03-17 23:38–23:50 Eastern
**Git commit:** `d2cd69f`
**Branch:** main
**Model:** claude-sonnet-4-6

### Audit Highlights

**Phase 0 — Architecture:**
~2600-line MCP server (index.ts) with 5 services, permissions layer, escalation system, and settings UI. 30+ tools exposed. All tools route through `permissions.check()` except two meta escalation tools.

**Phase 1 — Functionality:**
- MEDIUM: `get_emails_by_label` used unvalidated `args.label` to build IMAP path `Labels/${label}` — same traversal risk as constructing `Labels/../INBOX`
- MEDIUM: `move_to_folder` used unvalidated `args.folder` to build `Folders/${folder}`
- MEDIUM: `remove_label` and `bulk_remove_label` used unvalidated `args.targetFolder` directly as IMAP path
- LOW: `list_labels` brittle detection pattern (minor)
- LOW: `Math.min(...dates)` spread risk on large arrays in analytics (mitigated by 200-email cap)

**Phase 2 — Logic:**
- Rate-bucket memory is bounded by tool count (~45). No leak.
- Analytics cache inflight correctly uses finally block.
- Scheduler items array has no growth cap on completed records (noted for future cycle).

**Phase 3 — Security:**
- HIGH/MEDIUM: 4 handlers missing label/folder validation before IMAP path construction (fixed this cycle)
- All header injection defenses verified (stripHeaderInjection applied to subject, inReplyTo, references, custom headers, filenames, contentType)
- Attachment limits, recipient caps, email validation RFC 5321 compliance all verified

**Phase 4 — Documentation:**
- `migrateCredentials` import in index.ts is used (line 2589) — initial assessment was incorrect
- Duplicate step "3." in graceful shutdown comments (minor, noted for future cycle)

### Work Completed This Cycle

1. **`get_emails_by_label`** — Added label validation (non-empty, no `/`, no `..`, no control chars, max 255 chars) before constructing `Labels/${label}` IMAP path. Matches existing validation in `move_to_label`. (+10 lines)

2. **`move_to_folder`** — Added folder validation (same rules) before constructing `Folders/${folder}` IMAP path. (+10 lines)

3. **`remove_label`** — Added `targetFolder` validation (no `..`, no control chars, max 1000 chars) before use as direct IMAP path. Defaults to INBOX when omitted/empty. (+9 lines)

4. **`bulk_remove_label`** — Same targetFolder validation as `remove_label`. (+10 lines)

**Files changed:** `src/index.ts` (+39 lines), `LAST_AUDIT_SUMMARY.md` (new)

### Validation Results

- `npm run build` — PASS (0 TypeScript errors)
- `npm run lint` — PASS (tsc --noEmit clean)
- `npm test` — PASS (212/212 tests, 14 test files)

### Git Status

- Commit: `d2cd69f`
- Pushed to: `origin/main`

### Next Cycle Focus

**Priority items for Cycle #2:**
1. Add a cap/cleanup to `SchedulerService.items` — prune completed/failed/cancelled records older than N days to prevent unbounded growth
2. Fix comment numbering in graceful shutdown (two "3." labels)
3. Investigate `list_labels` detection logic — consider whether `f.name?.startsWith("Labels/")` check is needed
4. Consider adding `Analytics.getEmailStats()` `Math.min(...dates)` spread to use reduce instead
5. Add test coverage for new label/folder validation in the new handlers (unit tests for `get_emails_by_label`, `move_to_folder`, `remove_label`, `bulk_remove_label` with invalid inputs)

---

## Cycle #2
**Timestamp:** 2026-03-17 23:50–00:00 Eastern
**Git commit:** `6202880`
**Branch:** main
**Model:** claude-sonnet-4-6

### Audit Highlights (new findings this cycle)

No new HIGH/MEDIUM issues found. Confirmed all cycle 1 fixes still intact.

**Confirmed from Next Cycle Focus list:**
- `scheduler.ts` — `this.items` array has no growth cap (now fixed)
- `analytics-service.ts` — `Math.min/max(...dates)` spread pattern (now fixed)
- `index.ts` — graceful shutdown had two "// 3." comments (now fixed)
- `index.ts` — `list_labels` had redundant `f.name?.startsWith("Labels/")` condition (now fixed)
- Validation in 4 handlers was inline-only, not testable from outside (now extracted to helpers)

### Work Completed This Cycle

1. **Extract validation helpers to `src/utils/helpers.ts`** — Added `validateLabelName`, `validateFolderName`, and `validateTargetFolder` as exported functions, each returning `null` on success or an error message on failure. (+65 lines)

2. **Refactor 4 handlers in `src/index.ts` to use helpers** — `get_emails_by_label`, `move_to_folder`, `remove_label`, `bulk_remove_label` now call the helpers instead of inline blocks. No behavior change. (-39 lines inline, +8 lines calls)

3. **Add 30 new unit tests** — 27 tests in `src/utils/helpers.test.ts` covering all branches of the three new validation functions (empty, whitespace-only, null, slash, dotdot traversal, control chars, exact-limit boundary, over-limit). 2 tests in `src/services/scheduler.test.ts` for history pruning. (+166 lines)

4. **`SchedulerService.pruneHistory()` in `src/services/scheduler.ts`** — New private method called from `load()`. Keeps all pending items, drops non-pending records older than 30 days, caps non-pending history at 1000 records (sorted newest-first). (+55 lines)

5. **Fix `Math.min/max` spread in `src/services/analytics-service.ts`** — `getEmailStats()` now uses `reduce` for oldest/newest date computation. (+3 lines, -2 lines)

6. **Fix graceful shutdown comment** in `src/index.ts` — Second "// 3." changed to "// 4." (1 line)

7. **Remove redundant condition from `list_labels`** in `src/index.ts` — Removed `|| f.name?.startsWith("Labels/")` (IMAP folder `name` is the leaf, never has a path prefix). (1 line)

### Validation Results

- `npm run build` — PASS (0 TypeScript errors)
- `npm test` — PASS (242/242 tests, 14 test files, +30 new tests vs 212 in cycle 1)

### Git Status

- Commit: `6202880`
- Pushed to: `origin/main`

### Next Cycle Focus

**Priority items for Cycle #3:**
1. `move_email` and `bulk_move_emails` — `targetFolder` passed directly to `imapService.moveEmail()` without validation. Add `validateTargetFolder()` for consistency. (~5 lines, LOW risk)
2. `send_test_email` — add `isValidEmail(args.to)` check at handler level before SMTP. (~5 lines, LOW)
3. `parseEmails` silent dropping — log a warning for dropped invalid addresses in helpers.ts (~5 lines)
4. Cursor token HMAC binding — bind cursor to server instance (prevents cursor forgery). Low security impact.
5. IMAP connection health check (`NOOP` before ops) — medium effort, moderate risk

---

## Cycle #3
**Timestamp:** 2026-03-18 00:00–00:10 Eastern
**Git commit:** `d4a261a`
**Branch:** main
**Model:** claude-sonnet-4-6

### Audit Highlights (new findings this cycle)

No new HIGH/MEDIUM issues found. Confirmed all cycle 1 & 2 fixes still intact.

**Confirmed from Next Cycle Focus list:**
- `move_email` handler — `args.targetFolder` passed to `imapService.moveEmail()` without `validateTargetFolder()` (now fixed)
- `bulk_move_emails` handler — same gap (now fixed)
- `send_test_email` handler — `args.to` not validated before SMTP (now fixed)
- `parseEmails` — silently dropped invalid addresses with no log (now fixed)

**Additional audit findings (no new issues):**
- `archive_email`, `move_to_trash`, `move_to_spam` use hardcoded literal strings — no validation needed
- All 4 handlers that accept caller-supplied `targetFolder` now uniformly use `validateTargetFolder()`
- `send_email` delegates validation to smtpService; `send_test_email` now validates at handler level first

### Work Completed This Cycle

1. **`move_email`** — Added `validateTargetFolder(args.targetFolder)` check before `imapService.moveEmail()`. Returns `McpError(InvalidParams)` for `..`, control chars, or oversized strings. (+4 lines)

2. **`bulk_move_emails`** — Added `validateTargetFolder(args.targetFolder)` check before iterating IDs. Fails fast before touching any email. (+3 lines)

3. **`send_test_email`** — Added `isValidEmail(args.to)` check at handler entry. Returns `McpError(InvalidParams, "Invalid recipient email address: <addr>")`. (+3 lines)

4. **`parseEmails` in `src/utils/helpers.ts`** — Imported `logger`. Rewrote filter to a `for` loop that calls `logger.warn(...)` for each dropped invalid address. Callers using CC/BCC paths will now see warnings in logs. (+11 lines, -3 lines)

**Files changed:** `src/index.ts` (+10 lines), `src/utils/helpers.ts` (+17 lines, -5 lines)

### Validation Results

- `npm run build` — PASS (0 TypeScript errors)
- `npm test` — PASS (242/242 tests, 14 test files)

### Git Status

- Commit: `d4a261a`
- Pushed to: `origin/main`

### Next Cycle Focus

**Priority items for Cycle #4:**
1. Add tests for the new `move_email`, `bulk_move_emails`, `send_test_email` handler-level validation (invalid targetFolder / invalid email address inputs)
2. Cursor token HMAC binding — bind cursor JSON to HMAC-SHA256 keyed on a server-startup secret (LOW security impact, medium effort)
3. IMAP reconnect on silent TCP drop — `ensureConnection()` NOOP check (MEDIUM risk, medium effort)
4. `send_test_email` body emoji cleanup (cosmetic, trivial)
5. Review any remaining handlers that receive free-text user input without sanitization

---

## Cycle #4
**Timestamp:** 2026-03-18 00:10–00:15 Eastern
**Git commit:** `8ce8e69`
**Branch:** main
**Model:** claude-sonnet-4-6

### Audit Highlights (new findings this cycle)

No new HIGH/MEDIUM issues found. Confirmed all cycle 1, 2, & 3 fixes still intact.

**Audit areas checked:**
- `src/index.ts` — all folder/email handlers verified using `validateTargetFolder()`, `validateLabelName()`, `validateFolderName()`, or `isValidEmail()` as appropriate. No gaps found.
- `encodeCursor`/`decodeCursor` confirmed present at lines 155–175 of index.ts. Cursor is base64url JSON with field-type validation on decode. HMAC binding remains on the architectural backlog.
- `send_test_email` emoji — confirmed in `smtp-service.ts` (email body), NOT in the tool description. CONTRIBUTING.md rule applies to tool descriptions only, but emoji in email subjects/bodies can cause rendering issues in some clients. Fixed as cosmetic cleanup.
- Handler-level validation for `move_email`, `bulk_move_emails`, `send_test_email` — confirmed correct in index.ts. No unit tests existed for these paths (index.ts cannot be imported in tests due to top-level env-var checks). Tests added to `helpers.test.ts` exercising the exact validation calls the handlers make.

### Work Completed This Cycle

1. **Add 16 unit tests for Cycle #3 handler validation** — Added three `describe` blocks to `src/utils/helpers.test.ts`:
   - `move_email handler validation (validateTargetFolder)` — 6 tests: valid INBOX, valid path with slash, traversal `../../etc`, null-byte injection, oversized string, undefined (omitted) input
   - `bulk_move_emails handler validation (validateTargetFolder)` — 3 tests: valid destination, path traversal `Folders/../INBOX`, control character injection
   - `send_test_email handler validation (isValidEmail)` — 7 tests: valid address, missing domain, missing `@`, null byte, newline (header injection), empty string, local part >64 chars
   (+105 lines in helpers.test.ts)

2. **Remove emoji from `sendTestEmail` body in `src/services/smtp-service.ts`** — Subject changed from `"🧪 Test Email from ProtonMail MCP"` to `"Test Email from ProtonMail MCP"`. H2 and paragraph emoji removed. Plain ASCII text only. (-3 emoji occurrences)

**Files changed:** `src/utils/helpers.test.ts` (+105 lines), `src/services/smtp-service.ts` (3 lines changed)

### Validation Results

- `npm run build` — PASS (0 TypeScript errors)
- `npm test` — PASS (258/258 tests, 14 test files, +16 new tests vs 242 in cycle 3)

### Git Status

- Commit: `8ce8e69`
- Pushed to: `origin/main`

### Next Cycle Focus

**Priority items for Cycle #5:**
1. Cursor token HMAC binding — STILL SKIPPED (medium complexity, low security payoff). Defer until a dedicated cycle.
2. IMAP reconnect / NOOP health check — STILL SKIPPED (medium risk).
3. Review free-text user inputs not yet covered: `search_emails` `from`/`to`/`subject` fields passed to IMAP SEARCH — check whether imapflow sanitizes these or if there is an injection risk.
4. Review `get_email_by_id` / `download_attachment` — `emailId` and `attachmentIndex` args not validated for type/range at handler level before IMAP call.
5. `decodeCursor` — the `parsed.folder` field is accepted as-is without `validateTargetFolder()` check; a crafted cursor could inject a traversal path into the IMAP `getEmails()` call. LOW severity but worth closing.

---

## Cycle #5
**Timestamp:** 2026-03-18 00:30–00:45 Eastern
**Git commit:** `eb6d607`
**Branch:** main
**Model:** claude-sonnet-4-6

### Audit Highlights (new findings this cycle)

No new HIGH/MEDIUM issues found. Confirmed all cycle 1–4 fixes still intact.

**Confirmed from Next Cycle Focus list:**
- `decodeCursor` — `parsed.folder` NOT validated before returning `EmailCursor`. A crafted base64url cursor with `../../etc` as the folder field would be accepted by the type check (`typeof parsed.folder === "string"`) and passed directly to `imapService.getEmails()`. (now fixed)
- `get_email_by_id` handler — `args.emailId` cast as `string` with no non-empty / numeric check. Service's `validateEmailId` throws with an opaque internal error message on bad input. (now fixed with handler-level guard)
- `download_attachment` handler — `args.email_id` has no non-empty check; `args.attachment_index` has no integer/range guard at handler level (service does `Math.trunc` + bounds check, returns null with generic "Attachment not found" for invalid index). (now fixed)

**Additional audit findings:**
- `search_emails` `from`/`to`/`subject` fields — passed to imapflow `search()` criteria object. imapflow encodes IMAP SEARCH criteria via its own serialiser; no string interpolation into raw IMAP commands. Risk is LOW; callers see whatever imapflow produces for odd inputs. No handler-level guard added (imapflow handles this).
- All other handlers reviewed: no additional missing guards found. `cancel_scheduled_email` `args.id` — scheduler returns false for unknown IDs without a guard, but this is benign (no injection risk, friendly error already returned).

### Work Completed This Cycle

1. **`decodeCursor`** — Added `validateTargetFolder(parsed.folder) !== null` check inside `decodeCursor` before returning the cursor. Rejects cursors whose folder field contains `..`, control chars, or exceeds 1000 chars. Returns null (treated as "Invalid or expired cursor" by callers). (+2 lines)

2. **`get_email_by_id`** — Added `!/^\d+$/.test(rawEmailId)` guard at handler entry. Returns `McpError(InvalidParams, "emailId must be a non-empty numeric UID string.")` for empty, non-string, or non-numeric inputs. (+3 lines)

3. **`download_attachment`** — Added `!/^\d+$/.test(rawAttEmailId)` guard on `email_id` and `!Number.isInteger(rawAttIdx) || rawAttIdx < 0` guard on `attachment_index`. Both return `McpError(InvalidParams, ...)` with clear messages. (+6 lines)

**Files changed:** `src/index.ts` (+16 lines, -5 lines)

### Validation Results

- `npm run build` — PASS (0 TypeScript errors)
- `npm test` — PASS (258/258 tests, 14 test files)

### Git Status

- Commit: `eb6d607`
- Pushed to: `origin/main`

### Next Cycle Focus

**Priority items for Cycle #6:**
1. Add unit tests for new `decodeCursor` folder-validation path and `get_email_by_id` / `download_attachment` handler-level guards (similar pattern to Cycle #4 test additions). (~20 tests, LOW risk)
2. `search_emails` `from`/`to`/`subject` — consider adding max-length guards (e.g. 500 chars) to prevent excessively large IMAP SEARCH commands. LOW risk, LOW effort.
3. Cursor token HMAC binding — architectural backlog, defer.
4. IMAP reconnect / NOOP health check — architectural backlog, defer.

## Cycle #7
**Timestamp:** 2026-03-18 01:05–01:15 Eastern
**Git commit:** `714ec11`
**Branch:** main
**Model:** claude-sonnet-4-6

### Audit Highlights (new findings this cycle)

No new HIGH/MEDIUM issues found. Confirmed all cycle 1–6 fixes still intact.

**Confirmed from Next Cycle Focus list:**
- `create_folder` handler — `args.folderName as string` passed directly to IMAP service with no handler-level `validateFolderName()` call. Service's private `validateFolderName()` does protect, but throws a raw `Error` (opaque internal message). (now fixed)
- `delete_folder` handler — same gap as `create_folder`. (now fixed)
- `rename_folder` handler — `args.oldName` and `args.newName` both unguarded at handler level. (now fixed)
- `mark_email_read` / `star_email` handlers — `args.emailId as string` had no numeric UID guard at handler level, unlike `get_email_by_id` (fixed in Cycle #5). Service's private `validateEmailId` throws raw `Error`. (now fixed)

**Additional audit findings (no new issues):**
- `reply_to_email` `inReplyTo` and `references` come from `original.inReplyTo` / `original.references` (fetched from IMAP trusted storage), not user args. SMTP service applies `stripHeaderInjection` on outbound — no additional guard needed.
- `sync_folders` takes no args — no validation needed.
- `save_draft` `inReplyTo`/`references` come from user args but are passed to SMTP service which sanitizes them via `stripHeaderInjection`. No injection risk identified.
- `mark_email_unread` does not exist as a separate case — handled by `mark_email_read` with `isRead: false`.
- `unstar_email` does not exist as a separate case — handled by `star_email` with `isStarred: false`.

**Systematic scan conclusion:** All string args in switch cases that reach IMAP path construction or SMTP now have either handler-level validation or are protected by hardcoded literals / service-layer sanitization. No new gaps found beyond the 5 handlers addressed this cycle.

### Work Completed This Cycle

1. **`create_folder`** — Added `validateFolderName(args.folderName)` check at handler entry. Returns `McpError(InvalidParams)` for empty, slash-containing, traversal, control-char, or oversized names before IMAP call. (+4 lines)

2. **`delete_folder`** — Added identical `validateFolderName(args.folderName)` check. (+3 lines)

3. **`rename_folder`** — Added `validateFolderName(args.oldName)` and `validateFolderName(args.newName)` checks, each prefixing the field name in the error message for clarity. (+5 lines)

4. **`mark_email_read`** — Added `!/^\d+$/.test(merEmailId)` guard matching the existing `get_email_by_id` pattern. Returns `McpError(InvalidParams, "emailId must be a non-empty numeric UID string.")` (+4 lines)

5. **`star_email`** — Same numeric UID guard as `mark_email_read`. (+4 lines)

6. **Add 27 unit tests** — Three new `describe` blocks in `src/utils/helpers.test.ts`:
   - `create_folder / delete_folder handler validation (validateFolderName)` — 12 tests: valid names, empty, whitespace, null, undefined, slash, traversal, null byte, C0 control char, exact-255 boundary, 256 over-limit
   - `rename_folder handler validation (validateFolderName for oldName and newName)` — 5 tests: valid oldName/newName, traversal in oldName, empty newName, slash in newName
   - `mark_email_read / star_email handler validation (numeric emailId guard)` — 10 tests: valid "42", valid "1", empty, alphabetic, mixed, negative, float, null, undefined, null-byte injection
   (+125 lines in helpers.test.ts)

**Files changed:** `src/index.ts` (+20 lines, -2 lines), `src/utils/helpers.test.ts` (+125 lines)

### Validation Results

- `npm run build` — PASS (0 TypeScript errors)
- `npm test` — PASS (314/314 tests, 14 test files, +27 new tests vs 287 in cycle 6)

### Git Status

- Commit: `714ec11`
- Pushed to: `origin/main`

### Next Cycle Focus

**Priority items for Cycle #8:**
1. Remaining `args.X as Y` casts type-check audit — scan all remaining handlers for `as string` / `as number` / `as boolean` casts where the value reaches a service call without a runtime type-check at handler level. Focus on any cast where the JSON schema type is not strictly enforced by the MCP layer.
2. `save_draft` / `schedule_email` — audit `args.attachments as any` — check whether attachment objects (name, content, contentType) are validated or sanitized before IMAP `APPEND`.
3. Cursor token HMAC binding — still deferred (medium effort, low security payoff).
4. IMAP reconnect / NOOP health check — still deferred (medium effort, moderate risk).

## Cycle #8
**Timestamp:** 2026-03-18 01:20–01:35 Eastern
**Git commit:** `e0aa1dd`
**Branch:** main
**Model:** claude-sonnet-4-6

### Audit Highlights (new findings this cycle)

No new HIGH/MEDIUM issues found. Confirmed all cycle 1–7 fixes still intact.

**Confirmed from Next Cycle Focus list:**
- `archive_email`, `move_to_trash`, `move_to_spam` — `args.emailId as string` with no handler-level numeric UID guard. IMAP service's private `validateEmailId` protected internally but produced raw `Error` (opaque message). (now fixed — consistent with `get_email_by_id`, `mark_email_read`, `star_email`)
- `move_email` — had targetFolder validation (Cycle #3) but no emailId guard at handler level. (now fixed)
- `delete_email` — same gap as move handlers. (now fixed)
- `bulk_delete_emails`, `bulk_move_emails`, `bulk_mark_read`, `bulk_star`, `bulk_move_to_label`, `bulk_remove_label` — all filtered `typeof id === "string" && id.length > 0` but did NOT validate items as numeric UIDs. Non-numeric strings silently passed to IMAP service, which threw a raw `Error`. (now fixed — filter updated to `/^\d+$/.test(id)`)
- `get_emails` folder — passed to `imapService.getEmails()` via `validateTargetFolder()`-free path. IMAP service's private `validateFolderName` guards empty/control-chars/length but NOT `..` traversal. (now fixed)

**Systematic scan conclusion:** All `args.emailId as string` casts in all handlers now have handler-level numeric UID guards. All bulk operations now filter to numeric UIDs. `get_emails` folder now validated. No remaining gaps found.

**Areas reviewed with no gaps:**
- `mark_email_unread` / `unstar_email`: Not separate cases — handled by `mark_email_read`/`star_email` with flag values (confirmed in Cycle #7, still intact).
- `get_folder_emails`: Does not exist as a case — no action needed.
- `request_permission_escalation` targetPreset: Uses `isValidEscalationTarget()` (imported from settings/security.ts) — already protected.
- `sync_emails` folder: Same `validateTargetFolder` gap as `get_emails` — also fixed this cycle.

### Work Completed This Cycle

1. **`archive_email`, `move_to_trash`, `move_to_spam`** — Added `!/^\d+$/.test(emailId)` guard matching the existing pattern from `get_email_by_id`. Each handler now holds a named local variable (aeEmailId, mttEmailId, mtsEmailId) and throws `McpError(InvalidParams, "emailId must be a non-empty numeric UID string.")` for invalid inputs. (+9 lines each, 3 handlers)

2. **`move_email`** — Added numeric UID guard on `args.emailId` before the existing `validateTargetFolder` check. (+4 lines)

3. **`delete_email`** — Added numeric UID guard. (+4 lines)

4. **`get_emails`** — Added `validateTargetFolder(folder)` check immediately after resolving the folder default ("INBOX"). Returns `McpError(InvalidParams)` for traversal/control-char/oversized folder names. (+3 lines)

5. **Bulk operations array-item filter** — Updated the `.filter()` predicate in `bulk_delete_emails`, `bulk_move_emails`, `bulk_mark_read`, `bulk_star`, `bulk_move_to_label`, and `bulk_remove_label` from `id.length > 0` to `/^\d+$/.test(id)`. Non-numeric IDs are now silently excluded before the IMAP call rather than producing opaque service errors. (6 handlers, 1 line each)

6. **Add 33 unit tests** — Three new `describe` blocks in `src/utils/helpers.test.ts`:
   - `archive_email / move_to_trash / move_to_spam / move_email / delete_email handler validation (numeric emailId guard)` — 11 tests: valid "42", valid "1", valid "999999", empty, "abc", "12x", "-5", "3.14", null, undefined, null-byte
   - `get_emails handler validation (validateTargetFolder for folder arg)` — 9 tests: INBOX, Folders/Work, empty, undefined, traversal, embedded-traversal, null-byte, over-limit, exact-limit
   - `bulk operation array-item numeric UID filter` — 13 tests: valid "42"/"1"/"100000", empty, "abc", "12x", "-3", "2.5", null, undefined, number 42 (not string), null-byte, array-of-mixed-inputs

**Files changed:** `src/index.ts` (+40 lines, -12 lines), `src/utils/helpers.test.ts` (+151 lines)

### Validation Results

- `npm run build` — PASS (0 TypeScript errors)
- `npm test` — PASS (347/347 tests, 14 test files, +33 new tests vs 314 in cycle 7)

### Git Status

- Commit: `e0aa1dd`
- Pushed to: `origin/main`

### Next Cycle Focus

**Priority items for Cycle #9:**
1. `save_draft` / `schedule_email` attachment validation — `args.attachments as any` passes attachment objects directly to `imapService.saveDraft()`. Attachment `name`, `contentType`, `content` fields not validated at handler level. Risk is LOW (base64 content, MIME encoding by nodemailer/imapflow), but worth closing for completeness.
2. `move_to_label` / `remove_label` emailId — these two handlers still use `args.emailId as string` without a handler-level numeric UID guard (the IMAP service protects internally). Add guard for consistency.
3. IMAP reconnect / NOOP health check — architectural backlog, still deferred.
4. Cursor token HMAC binding — architectural backlog, still deferred.

## Cycle #9
**Timestamp:** 2026-03-18 01:40–01:55 Eastern
**Git commit:** `a30de17`
**Branch:** main
**Model:** claude-sonnet-4-6

### Audit Highlights (new findings this cycle)

No new HIGH/MEDIUM issues found. Confirmed all cycle 1–8 fixes still intact.

**Confirmed from Next Cycle Focus list:**
- `move_to_label` handler — `args.emailId as string` passed to `imapService.moveEmail()` without handler-level numeric UID guard. Inconsistent with all other single-email action handlers. (now fixed)
- `remove_label` handler — same gap as `move_to_label`. (now fixed)
- `save_draft` / `schedule_email` attachment validation — `args.attachments as any` passed to services without handler-level field validation.

**New finding on attachment path:**
- `schedule_email` → `schedulerService.schedule()` → eventual `smtpService.sendEmail()`. The SMTP service already has full attachment validation (count cap, size cap, filename/contentType header-injection stripping, MIME type format check). No gap on this path.
- `save_draft` → `imapService.saveDraft()`. The `saveDraft` method in `simple-imap-service.ts` passed `att.filename` and `att.contentType` directly to nodemailer without ANY sanitization — unlike `smtp-service.ts` which strips CRLF/NUL from both fields and validates contentType format. A crafted attachment with `filename: "a.pdf\r\nContent-Type: text/html"` or `contentType: "text/html\r\nX-Injected: yes"` would break the MIME structure of the saved draft. This is a real (LOW severity) gap — now fixed at the service layer.

**Systematic scan conclusion:** ALL single-email action handlers now have handler-level numeric UID guards. The handler-level validation sweep that began in Cycle #5 is now complete for all handlers.

### Work Completed This Cycle

1. **`move_to_label`** — Added `!/^\d+$/.test(mtlEmailId)` guard at handler entry before label validation. Local variable `mtlEmailId` used (consistent naming convention). `imapService.moveEmail()` now receives the validated variable, not the raw `args.emailId as string` cast. (+4 lines)

2. **`remove_label`** — Added identical `!/^\d+$/.test(rlEmailId)` guard before the existing `validateTargetFolder` check. (+4 lines)

3. **`saveDraft` attachment sanitization in `simple-imap-service.ts`** — Replaced the raw `att.filename` / `att.contentType` pass-through with inline sanitization mirroring `smtp-service.ts`:
   - `filename`: strip CRLF/NUL with `replace(/[\r\n\x00]/g, "")`, truncate to 255 chars, fall back to `"attachment"` if empty after strip.
   - `contentType`: strip CRLF/NUL, validate against `/^[\w!#$&\-^]+\/[\w!#$&\-^+.]+$/` (type/subtype format), fall back to `undefined` if invalid.
   (+17 lines, -5 lines)

4. **Add 27 unit tests** — Three new `describe` blocks in `src/utils/helpers.test.ts`:
   - `move_to_label / remove_label handler validation (numeric emailId guard)` — 11 tests: valid "42"/"1"/"999999", empty, "abc", "12x", "-5", "3.14", null, undefined, null-byte
   - `saveDraft attachment filename sanitization` — 7 tests: plain filename, CRLF injection, LF injection, NUL byte, over-255-char, empty-after-strip fallback, undefined
   - `saveDraft attachment contentType sanitization` — 9 tests: valid "application/pdf"/"image/png"/"text/plain", CRLF injection rejected, NUL byte stripped then validated, no-slash rejected, empty undefined, undefined, spaces rejected
   (+128 lines in helpers.test.ts)

**Files changed:** `src/index.ts` (+8 lines), `src/services/simple-imap-service.ts` (+17 lines, -5 lines), `src/utils/helpers.test.ts` (+128 lines)

### Validation Results

- `npm run build` — PASS (0 TypeScript errors)
- `npm test` — PASS (374/374 tests, 14 test files, +27 new tests vs 347 in cycle 8)

### Git Status

- Commit: `a30de17`
- Pushed to: `origin/main`

### Next Cycle Focus

**Handler-level validation sweep is now COMPLETE.** All single-email action handlers and folder-path handlers have been hardened over Cycles #1–#9. Shift focus to code quality, documentation, and test coverage gaps.

**Priority items for Cycle #10:**
1. Code quality — scan for unused imports in `src/index.ts` and service files (`import X from Y` that are never referenced). Remove dead code. (~LOW effort, improves maintainability)
2. Type safety — find remaining `as any` casts in production code (not test files). Assess whether they can be narrowed to proper types. Focus on `src/index.ts` and service files.
3. JSDoc coverage — add JSDoc comments to public methods in `src/services/` that are missing them (particularly `SimpleIMAPService` and `SmtpService` public methods). (~LOW effort, improves documentation)
4. IMAP reconnect / NOOP health check — architectural backlog, still deferred (medium effort, moderate risk).
5. Cursor token HMAC binding — architectural backlog, still deferred.

## Cycle #10
**Timestamp:** 2026-03-18 02:00–02:20 Eastern
**Git commit:** `d9242ee`
**Branch:** main
**Model:** claude-sonnet-4-6

### Audit Highlights (new findings this cycle)

No new HIGH/MEDIUM issues found. Confirmed all cycle 1–9 fixes still intact.

**`as any` scan — `src/index.ts` (7 occurrences identified):**
- Line 1360: `(request.params as any)._meta?.progressToken` — AVOIDABLE. SDK's `CallToolRequestSchema` types `request.params._meta?.progressToken` directly (per `types.d.ts` line 29735). No cast needed.
- Lines 1516, 1755, 1784: `args.attachments as any[] | undefined` / `args.attachments as any | undefined` — AVOIDABLE. All three call sites pass to functions expecting `EmailAttachment[] | undefined`. Narrowed correctly; required adding `EmailAttachment` to the import.
- Lines 2723–2729: `(config.smtp as any).password = ""` etc. — AVOIDABLE. `SMTPConfig` and `IMAPConfig` interfaces use non-readonly fields. Direct assignment compiles cleanly.
- `progressToken` unused variable reference verified: `progressToken` IS referenced later in the file (progress notification path) — not dead code.

**`as any` scan — `src/services/simple-imap-service.ts` (4 occurrences):**
- Line 774: `(result as any).uid` — REQUIRED. imapflow's `client.append()` return type does not include `uid` in its TypeScript declaration even though the runtime value includes it. Cannot remove without a custom type declaration file (deferred).
- Lines 1188–1196 (`wipeCache`): `(email as any).body = ""` etc. — AVOIDABLE. `EmailMessage.body`, `.subject`, `.from` are plain mutable `string` fields. Direct assignment works.
- Line 1196: `(att as any).content = undefined` — REQUIRED. `EmailAttachment.content` is typed `Buffer | string` (no `undefined`). Must preserve cast.

**`as any` scan — `src/services/analytics-service.ts` (6 occurrences in `wipeData`):**
- Lines 384–391: `(email as any).body/subject/from = ""` — AVOIDABLE. Same reason as `wipeCache`. Direct assignment compiles cleanly.

**`helpers.ts` review:**
- `validateFolderName`: contained a redundant `(folder as string).length` cast at the length check — TypeScript already narrows `folder` to `string` via the guard on line 201. Removed.
- `truncate()`: had only a one-line stub JSDoc. Expanded to full parameter-level docs.
- All other public functions: already have adequate JSDoc. No additional gaps found.

**`permissions/manager.ts` review:**
- All public methods (`check`, `rateLimitStatus`, `invalidate`) have JSDoc. Private helpers documented via inline comments. No type-safety gaps.

**`types/index.ts` review:**
- `LogEntry.data?: any` — appropriate use of `any` for unstructured log metadata. Leave as-is.
- `EmailAttachment.content?: Buffer | string` — `undefined` omitted deliberately (attached content must be present). Consistent with existing code.
- No required/optional field mismatches identified. All types complete.

**Unused imports scan — `src/index.ts`:**
- After adding `EmailAttachment` to line 24, all imports verified referenced. No unused imports found.

### Work Completed This Cycle

1. **`src/index.ts` line 1360** — Removed `as any` cast on `request.params._meta?.progressToken`. SDK type already covers this access. (−1 cast)

2. **`src/index.ts` lines 2723–2729** — Removed `as any` casts on credential scrubbing in shutdown handler. `config.smtp.password = ""` etc. compiles directly against `SMTPConfig`/`IMAPConfig` interfaces. (−5 casts)

3. **`src/index.ts` lines 1516, 1755, 1784** — Narrowed `args.attachments as any[] | undefined` / `as any | undefined` to `as EmailAttachment[] | undefined` in `send_email`, `save_draft`, and `schedule_email` handlers. Added `EmailAttachment` to line-24 import. (−3 casts, +1 import name)

4. **`src/services/simple-imap-service.ts` `wipeCache()`** — Replaced `(email as any).body/subject/from = ""` with direct property writes. (−3 casts)

5. **`src/services/analytics-service.ts` `wipeData()`** — Same fix for inbox and sent email loops. (−6 casts)

6. **`src/utils/helpers.ts` `validateFolderName()`** — Removed redundant `(folder as string).length` cast inside the post-guard length check. (−1 redundant cast)

7. **`src/utils/helpers.ts` `truncate()`** — Replaced one-line stub JSDoc with a full multi-line JSDoc including `@param` tags for `text` and `maxLength` with usage notes. (+5 lines)

**Total `as any` casts removed from production code this cycle: 9**
**Remaining unavoidable `as any` casts in production code: 2** (`(result as any).uid` in `client.append()` return; `(att as any).content = undefined` where type omits undefined)

**Files changed:** `src/index.ts` (import + 9 cast removals), `src/services/analytics-service.ts` (6 cast removals), `src/services/simple-imap-service.ts` (3 cast removals), `src/utils/helpers.ts` (1 cast removal + JSDoc)

### Validation Results

- `npm run build` — PASS (0 TypeScript errors, verified after each individual change)
- `npm test` — PASS (374/374 tests, 14 test files, no count change — no new tests this cycle)

### Git Status

- Commit: `d9242ee`
- Pushed to: `origin/main`

### Next Cycle Focus

**Priority items for Cycle #11:**
1. JSDoc coverage — `SimpleIMAPService` and `SmtpService` public methods still largely undocumented. Adding JSDoc to the top-10 most-used public methods (e.g. `connect`, `disconnect`, `getEmails`, `getEmailById`, `saveDraft`, `sendEmail`, `markEmailRead`, `starEmail`, `moveEmail`, `searchEmails`). (~LOW effort, improves IDE support)
2. `(result as any).uid` in `simple-imap-service.ts` — Consider adding a small local interface `interface AppendResult { uid?: number }` to replace the `as any` cast cleanly. (~5 lines, zero risk)
3. `(att as any).content = undefined` in `wipeCache` — Consider making `EmailAttachment.content` optional (`content?: Buffer | string`) to allow direct null-out. Check whether any existing code assumes content is always defined. (~LOW effort, ~LOW risk)
4. IMAP reconnect / NOOP health check — architectural backlog, still deferred.
5. Cursor token HMAC binding — architectural backlog, still deferred.

## Cycle #11
**Timestamp:** 2026-03-18 02:25–02:40 Eastern
**Git commit:** `ec1aaf7`
**Branch:** main
**Model:** claude-sonnet-4-6

### Audit Highlights (new findings this cycle)

No new HIGH/MEDIUM issues found. Confirmed all cycle 1–10 fixes still intact.

**Confirmed from Next Cycle Focus list:**
- `(result as any).uid` in `saveDraft` — imapflow `client.append()` return type omits `uid`. A local `interface AppendResult { uid?: number }` replaces the cast cleanly. (now fixed)
- `(att as any).content = undefined` in `wipeCache` — `EmailAttachment.content` was ALREADY typed as `content?: Buffer | string` (optional) in `types/index.ts`. The `as any` cast was entirely unnecessary. Direct `att.content = undefined` compiles cleanly. (now fixed)
- JSDoc coverage for public methods — `connect`, `disconnect`, `isActive`, `getFolders`, `getEmails`, `getEmailById`, `searchEmails`, `markEmailRead`, `starEmail`, `moveEmail` in `SimpleIMAPService`; `verifyConnection`, `sendEmail`, `sendTestEmail`, `close` in `SmtpService`. All 14 methods now documented. `saveDraft` already had JSDoc from a prior addition.

**Zero production `as any` casts remaining in production code** — all three cast sites in `simple-imap-service.ts` addressed over Cycles #10 and #11. `analytics-service.ts` and `index.ts` also clean. `smtp-service.ts` `wipeCredentials()` still has `(config.smtp as any).password` casts — noted for Cycle #12.

### Work Completed This Cycle

1. **Add `interface AppendResult { uid?: number }` to `src/services/simple-imap-service.ts`** — One-line local interface added immediately after imports. Changed `(result as any).uid` to `(result as AppendResult).uid` in `saveDraft`. Removes the last `as any` cast from the IMAP service. (+2 lines, -0 lines net; 1 cast narrowed)

2. **Fix `(att as any).content = undefined` in `wipeCache()`** — `EmailAttachment.content` is already `content?: Buffer | string` (optional since type declaration). The cast was spurious. Changed to direct `att.content = undefined`. (0 lines, 1 cast removed)

3. **Add JSDoc to 14 public methods in `SimpleIMAPService` and `SmtpService`:**
   - `SimpleIMAPService`: `connect` (6-line JSDoc with 5 @param), `disconnect` (1-line), `isActive` (1-line), `getFolders` (1-line), `getEmails` (5-line with @param/@returns), `getEmailById` (3-line with @param/@returns), `searchEmails` (3-line with @param/@returns), `markEmailRead` (4-line with @param/@returns), `starEmail` (4-line with @param/@returns), `moveEmail` (4-line with @param/@returns) — 10 methods
   - `SmtpService`: `verifyConnection` (1-line), `sendEmail` (3-line with @param/@returns), `sendTestEmail` (4-line with @param/@returns), `close` (1-line) — 4 methods
   (+62 lines documentation)

**Total `as any` casts in production code: 0** (excluding `smtp-service.ts` `wipeCredentials` which uses casts on `SMTPConfig` fields — these are avoidable and deferred to Cycle #12)

**Files changed:** `src/services/simple-imap-service.ts` (+64 lines, -2 lines), `src/services/smtp-service.ts` (+12 lines, -0 lines)

### Validation Results

- `npm run build` — PASS (0 TypeScript errors, verified after each change)
- `npm test` — PASS (374/374 tests, 14 test files, count unchanged — no new tests this cycle)

### Git Status

- Commit: `ec1aaf7`
- Pushed to: `origin/main`

### Next Cycle Focus

**All `as any` casts in primary service files now eliminated.** JSDoc coverage for core service public methods is complete.

**Priority items for Cycle #12:**
1. `smtp-service.ts` `wipeCredentials()` — still uses `(config.smtp as any).password = ""` etc. (3 casts). Avoidable: `SMTPConfig` fields are mutable strings, direct assignment compiles cleanly. (~LOW effort, 3 lines)
2. `clearCache()` in `simple-imap-service.ts` — no JSDoc comment. One-liner. (~trivial)
3. `wipeCache()` and `wipeCredentials()` in both services — both have brief JSDoc already. Review whether they need `@returns void` consistency.
4. IMAP reconnect / NOOP health check — architectural backlog, still deferred (medium effort, moderate risk).
5. Cursor token HMAC binding — architectural backlog, still deferred.

## Cycle #12
**Timestamp:** 2026-03-18 02:45–02:55 Eastern
**Git commit:** `e5a017c`
**Branch:** main
**Model:** claude-sonnet-4-6

### Audit Highlights (new findings this cycle)

No new HIGH/MEDIUM issues found. Confirmed all cycle 1–11 fixes still intact.

**Confirmed from Next Cycle Focus list:**
- `smtp-service.ts` `wipeCredentials()` — 3 `(config.smtp as any).X = ""` casts, all avoidable. `SMTPConfig` fields are plain mutable strings. Direct assignment compiles cleanly (confirmed from Cycle #10 where the same pattern was fixed in `index.ts`). (now fixed)
- `simple-imap-service.ts` `clearCache()` — public method with no JSDoc. (now fixed)

**New finding — `src/security/memory.ts` `scrubEmail()`:**
- 5 `as any` casts in `scrubEmail()`: `(email as any).body = ""`, `(email as any).subject = ""`, `(email as any).from = ""`, `(att as any).content = undefined`, `(att as any).filename = ""`. All avoidable: `EmailMessage.body/subject/from` are non-optional `string` fields (direct write works); `EmailAttachment.content` is `content?: Buffer | string` (optional, undefined assignable); `EmailAttachment.filename` is `string` (direct write works). (now fixed)

**Confirmed no `as any` in escalation.ts, loader.ts, keychain.ts** — grep returned zero matches in all three files. Clean.

**Remaining `as any` in production code (required/accepted):**
- `src/settings/tui.ts` — 4 casts accessing private readline internals (`_writeToOutput`). Required; no public API exists.
- `src/settings/server.ts` — 2 casts on `err as any` to access `.code` property. Standard TypeScript unknown-error pattern.
- `src/security/memory.ts` `wipeString(obj: any, ...)` — parameter typed `any` by design (generic utility).
- `src/security/memory.ts` `wipeObject(obj: Record<string, any>, ...)` — same.

**Zero avoidable `as any` casts remain anywhere in production code.**

### Work Completed This Cycle

1. **`smtp-service.ts` `wipeCredentials()`** — Replaced `(this.config.smtp as any).password = ""`, `(this.config.smtp as any).smtpToken = ""`, `(this.config.smtp as any).username = ""` with direct property writes. (−3 casts)

2. **`simple-imap-service.ts` `clearCache()`** — Added one-line JSDoc: "Clear all in-memory email and folder caches, forcing fresh IMAP fetches on next access." (+1 line documentation)

3. **`security/memory.ts` `scrubEmail()`** — Replaced all 5 spurious `as any` casts with direct property writes. `email.body`, `email.subject`, `email.from`, `att.filename` are non-optional mutable fields; `att.content` is optional (`content?: Buffer | string`) so `att.content = undefined` is valid. (−5 casts)

**Total `as any` casts removed from production code this cycle: 8**
**Total avoidable `as any` casts remaining in production code: 0**

**Files changed:** `src/services/smtp-service.ts` (3 casts removed), `src/services/simple-imap-service.ts` (1 JSDoc line added), `src/security/memory.ts` (5 casts removed)

### Validation Results

- `npm run build` — PASS (0 TypeScript errors)
- `npm test` — PASS (374/374 tests, 14 test files, count unchanged — no new tests this cycle)

### Git Status

- Commit: `e5a017c`
- Pushed to: `origin/main`

### Next Cycle Focus

**All avoidable `as any` casts in production code eliminated.** JSDoc coverage for public methods complete.

**Priority items for Cycle #13:**
1. `healthCheck()` method on `SimpleIMAPService` — send IMAP NOOP to detect silent TCP drops. Don't wire into server yet. (MEDIUM effort, test in isolation first)
2. Improving error messages in IMAP service when connection is unexpectedly lost — currently surfaces raw imapflow errors. Wrap `ensureConnection` errors with friendly "IMAP connection lost. Please reconnect." message.
3. DRY audit — check for repeated code blocks (3+ copies of same logic) across service files. Top candidate: numeric emailId guard repeated in ~12 handlers in `index.ts` (could be extracted to a helper function like `parseNumericEmailId()`).
4. Cursor token HMAC binding — architectural backlog, still deferred.

## Cycle #6
**Timestamp:** 2026-03-18 00:50–01:00 Eastern
**Git commit:** `403dcaa`
**Branch:** main
**Model:** claude-sonnet-4-6

### Audit Highlights (new findings this cycle)

No new HIGH/MEDIUM issues found. Confirmed all cycle 1–5 fixes still intact.

**Confirmed from Next Cycle Focus list:**
- `decodeCursor` — `validateTargetFolder` guard added in Cycle #5 had no unit tests covering its various rejection paths. (now tested)
- `get_email_by_id` — numeric UID guard from Cycle #5 had no unit tests. (now tested)
- `download_attachment` — `email_id` and `attachment_index` guards from Cycle #5 had no unit tests. (now tested)
- `search_emails` `from`/`to`/`subject` — no length cap at handler level. (now fixed)

**Additional audit items checked:**
- `search_emails` input schema reviewed: `from`, `to`, `subject` are unbound `string` fields with no `maxLength` in schema and no handler-level guard. Length checks added inline. imapflow encodes these safely; the new guard is defence-in-depth only.
- All other handlers reviewed — no additional gaps found.

### Work Completed This Cycle

1. **Add 29 unit tests in `src/utils/helpers.test.ts`** — Three new `describe` blocks:
   - `decodeCursor folder validation (validateTargetFolder)` — 8 tests: valid INBOX, valid path with slash, boundary (1000 chars), traversal `../../etc/passwd`, embedded `Labels/../INBOX`, null byte, C0 control char, over-limit (1001 chars)
   - `get_email_by_id handler validation (numeric UID guard)` — 10 tests: valid "12345", valid "1", empty string, "abc", "12a3", "-1", "1.5", null, undefined, null-byte injection
   - `download_attachment handler validation` — 11 tests: email_id valid/empty/non-numeric/null; attachment_index valid 0/valid 3/negative/-1/float 1.5/NaN/string "0"/undefined
   (+179 lines in helpers.test.ts)

2. **`search_emails` max-length guards** — Added `MAX_SEARCH_TEXT = 500` constant and three length checks (for `from`, `to`, `subject`) at handler entry in `src/index.ts`. Returns `McpError(InvalidParams)` with a clear message for each. (+12 lines)

**Files changed:** `src/utils/helpers.test.ts` (+179 lines), `src/index.ts` (+12 lines)

### Validation Results

- `npm run build` — PASS (0 TypeScript errors)
- `npm test` — PASS (287/287 tests, 14 test files, +29 new tests vs 258 in cycle 5)

### Git Status

- Commit: `403dcaa`
- Pushed to: `origin/main`

### Next Cycle Focus

**Priority items for Cycle #7:**
1. Cursor token HMAC binding — architectural backlog, still deferred (medium effort, low security payoff since cursors are ephemeral paginated tokens).
2. IMAP reconnect / NOOP health check — architectural backlog, still deferred (medium effort, moderate risk).
3. Review remaining any-typed `args` casts in handlers — identify whether any args are passed to services without a runtime type-check (find patterns like `args.X as Y` where Y is a complex type or object).
4. `create_folder` / `rename_folder` — `folderName` / `newName` args: check whether `validateFolderName()` (or equivalent) is called before passing to IMAP service.

## Cycle #13
**Timestamp:** 2026-03-18 03:00–03:30 Eastern
**Git commit:** `40a79f4`
**Branch:** main
**Model:** claude-sonnet-4-6

### Audit Highlights

**Phase 1 — DRY numeric emailId guard:**
The pattern `if (!X || typeof X !== "string" || !/^\d+$/.test(X)) throw new McpError(...)` was repeated across 11 individual handler cases (10 using field name "emailId", 1 using "email_id" for `download_attachment`), plus 1 looser variant in `compose_reply`. Total: 12 guard sites.

**Phase 2 — IMAP healthCheck gap:**
`isActive()` only checks the `isConnected` boolean flag. Silent TCP drops leave the flag true while the socket is dead. `ImapFlow.noop()` is available as the probe mechanism (confirmed at runtime). No `healthCheck()` method existed yet.

### Work Completed This Cycle

**[DONE] `requireNumericEmailId()` helper extracted to `src/utils/helpers.ts`**
- Signature: `requireNumericEmailId(raw: unknown, fieldName?: string): string`
- Throws `McpError(ErrorCode.InvalidParams, "<fieldName> must be a non-empty numeric UID string.")` on failure; returns the validated string on success.
- Added `McpError` / `ErrorCode` import to `helpers.ts`.
- Added export to `helpers.ts`; added import to `src/index.ts`.
- Replaced 12 guard sites in `src/index.ts`:
  - `get_email_by_id` (rawEmailId → `requireNumericEmailId(args.emailId)`)
  - `download_attachment` (rawAttEmailId → `requireNumericEmailId(args.email_id, "email_id")`)
  - `mark_email_read` (merEmailId)
  - `star_email` (seEmailId)
  - `move_email` (mvEmailId)
  - `archive_email` (aeEmailId)
  - `move_to_trash` (mttEmailId)
  - `move_to_spam` (mtsEmailId)
  - `move_to_label` (mtlEmailId)
  - `remove_label` (rlEmailId)
  - `delete_email` (deEmailId)
  - `compose_reply` (emailId — previously weaker pattern, now hardened to full guard)
- Net reduction: ~39 lines from `src/index.ts` (3 lines → 1 line per site).

**[DONE] `SimpleIMAPService.healthCheck()` added**
- Public method `async healthCheck(): Promise<boolean>`.
- Returns `false` immediately if `!client || !isConnected`.
- Issues `this.client.noop()` and returns `true` on success, `false` on any error.
- Never throws — all NOOP failures are caught and returned as `false`.
- Not yet wired into the server (additive only).

**[DONE] 19 new unit tests added (393 total)**
- `src/utils/helpers.test.ts`: 14 tests for `requireNumericEmailId` covering valid cases, custom fieldName in error, ErrorCode.InvalidParams on `empty string / "abc" / "12x" / "-5" / "3.14" / null / undefined / numeric(42) / null-byte`.
- `src/services/simple-imap-service.newfeatures.test.ts`: 5 tests for `healthCheck` covering `isConnected=false`, `client=null`, NOOP resolves (returns true), NOOP rejects (returns false), and no-throw guarantee.

### Validation Results

```
Test Files  14 passed (14)
Tests       393 passed (393)   ← was 374 before Cycle #13
Start at    00:37:56
Duration    2.13s
```

All pre-existing tests continued to pass. Zero regressions.

### Git Status
- Commit `40a79f4` pushed to `main`.
- 5 files changed: +179 insertions, -49 deletions.

### Next Cycle Focus
1. Wire `healthCheck()` into the server — add a `check_connection` tool or call from `ensureConnection()` as a reconnect probe before reporting failure.
2. `ensureConnection()` error wrapping — wrap reconnection failures with a friendly "IMAP connection lost; reconnect via the settings tool." message.
3. Review the `move_to_label` / `bulk_move_to_label` inline label validation (still duplicated inline) — extract to use `validateLabelName()` helper already in helpers.ts.
