## Cycle #1
**Timestamp:** 2026-03-17 23:38–23:50 Eastern
**Git commit:** `d2cd69f`
**Branch:** main
**Model:** claude-sonnet-4-6

### Audit Highlights

**Phase 0 — Architecture:**
~2600-line MCP server (index.ts) with 5 services, permissions layer, escalation system, and settings UI. 30+ tools exposed. All tools route through `permissions.check()` except two meta escalation tools.

**Phase 1 — Functionality:**
- MEDIUM: `get_emails_by_label` used unvalidated `args.label` to build IMAP path `Labels/${label}` — same traversal risk as constructing `Labels/../INBOX`
- MEDIUM: `move_to_folder` used unvalidated `args.folder` to build `Folders/${folder}`
- MEDIUM: `remove_label` and `bulk_remove_label` used unvalidated `args.targetFolder` directly as IMAP path
- LOW: `list_labels` brittle detection pattern (minor)
- LOW: `Math.min(...dates)` spread risk on large arrays in analytics (mitigated by 200-email cap)

**Phase 2 — Logic:**
- Rate-bucket memory is bounded by tool count (~45). No leak.
- Analytics cache inflight correctly uses finally block.
- Scheduler items array has no growth cap on completed records (noted for future cycle).

**Phase 3 — Security:**
- HIGH/MEDIUM: 4 handlers missing label/folder validation before IMAP path construction (fixed this cycle)
- All header injection defenses verified (stripHeaderInjection applied to subject, inReplyTo, references, custom headers, filenames, contentType)
- Attachment limits, recipient caps, email validation RFC 5321 compliance all verified

**Phase 4 — Documentation:**
- `migrateCredentials` import in index.ts is used (line 2589) — initial assessment was incorrect
- Duplicate step "3." in graceful shutdown comments (minor, noted for future cycle)

### Work Completed This Cycle

1. **`get_emails_by_label`** — Added label validation (non-empty, no `/`, no `..`, no control chars, max 255 chars) before constructing `Labels/${label}` IMAP path. Matches existing validation in `move_to_label`. (+10 lines)

2. **`move_to_folder`** — Added folder validation (same rules) before constructing `Folders/${folder}` IMAP path. (+10 lines)

3. **`remove_label`** — Added `targetFolder` validation (no `..`, no control chars, max 1000 chars) before use as direct IMAP path. Defaults to INBOX when omitted/empty. (+9 lines)

4. **`bulk_remove_label`** — Same targetFolder validation as `remove_label`. (+10 lines)

**Files changed:** `src/index.ts` (+39 lines), `LAST_AUDIT_SUMMARY.md` (new)

### Validation Results

- `npm run build` — PASS (0 TypeScript errors)
- `npm run lint` — PASS (tsc --noEmit clean)
- `npm test` — PASS (212/212 tests, 14 test files)

### Git Status

- Commit: `d2cd69f`
- Pushed to: `origin/main`

### Next Cycle Focus

**Priority items for Cycle #2:**
1. Add a cap/cleanup to `SchedulerService.items` — prune completed/failed/cancelled records older than N days to prevent unbounded growth
2. Fix comment numbering in graceful shutdown (two "3." labels)
3. Investigate `list_labels` detection logic — consider whether `f.name?.startsWith("Labels/")` check is needed
4. Consider adding `Analytics.getEmailStats()` `Math.min(...dates)` spread to use reduce instead
5. Add test coverage for new label/folder validation in the new handlers (unit tests for `get_emails_by_label`, `move_to_folder`, `remove_label`, `bulk_remove_label` with invalid inputs)

---

## Cycle #2
**Timestamp:** 2026-03-17 23:50–00:00 Eastern
**Git commit:** `6202880`
**Branch:** main
**Model:** claude-sonnet-4-6

### Audit Highlights (new findings this cycle)

No new HIGH/MEDIUM issues found. Confirmed all cycle 1 fixes still intact.

**Confirmed from Next Cycle Focus list:**
- `scheduler.ts` — `this.items` array has no growth cap (now fixed)
- `analytics-service.ts` — `Math.min/max(...dates)` spread pattern (now fixed)
- `index.ts` — graceful shutdown had two "// 3." comments (now fixed)
- `index.ts` — `list_labels` had redundant `f.name?.startsWith("Labels/")` condition (now fixed)
- Validation in 4 handlers was inline-only, not testable from outside (now extracted to helpers)

### Work Completed This Cycle

1. **Extract validation helpers to `src/utils/helpers.ts`** — Added `validateLabelName`, `validateFolderName`, and `validateTargetFolder` as exported functions, each returning `null` on success or an error message on failure. (+65 lines)

2. **Refactor 4 handlers in `src/index.ts` to use helpers** — `get_emails_by_label`, `move_to_folder`, `remove_label`, `bulk_remove_label` now call the helpers instead of inline blocks. No behavior change. (-39 lines inline, +8 lines calls)

3. **Add 30 new unit tests** — 27 tests in `src/utils/helpers.test.ts` covering all branches of the three new validation functions (empty, whitespace-only, null, slash, dotdot traversal, control chars, exact-limit boundary, over-limit). 2 tests in `src/services/scheduler.test.ts` for history pruning. (+166 lines)

4. **`SchedulerService.pruneHistory()` in `src/services/scheduler.ts`** — New private method called from `load()`. Keeps all pending items, drops non-pending records older than 30 days, caps non-pending history at 1000 records (sorted newest-first). (+55 lines)

5. **Fix `Math.min/max` spread in `src/services/analytics-service.ts`** — `getEmailStats()` now uses `reduce` for oldest/newest date computation. (+3 lines, -2 lines)

6. **Fix graceful shutdown comment** in `src/index.ts` — Second "// 3." changed to "// 4." (1 line)

7. **Remove redundant condition from `list_labels`** in `src/index.ts` — Removed `|| f.name?.startsWith("Labels/")` (IMAP folder `name` is the leaf, never has a path prefix). (1 line)

### Validation Results

- `npm run build` — PASS (0 TypeScript errors)
- `npm test` — PASS (242/242 tests, 14 test files, +30 new tests vs 212 in cycle 1)

### Git Status

- Commit: `6202880`
- Pushed to: `origin/main`

### Next Cycle Focus

**Priority items for Cycle #3:**
1. `move_email` and `bulk_move_emails` — `targetFolder` passed directly to `imapService.moveEmail()` without validation. Add `validateTargetFolder()` for consistency. (~5 lines, LOW risk)
2. `send_test_email` — add `isValidEmail(args.to)` check at handler level before SMTP. (~5 lines, LOW)
3. `parseEmails` silent dropping — log a warning for dropped invalid addresses in helpers.ts (~5 lines)
4. Cursor token HMAC binding — bind cursor to server instance (prevents cursor forgery). Low security impact.
5. IMAP connection health check (`NOOP` before ops) — medium effort, moderate risk

---

## Cycle #3
**Timestamp:** 2026-03-18 00:00–00:10 Eastern
**Git commit:** `d4a261a`
**Branch:** main
**Model:** claude-sonnet-4-6

### Audit Highlights (new findings this cycle)

No new HIGH/MEDIUM issues found. Confirmed all cycle 1 & 2 fixes still intact.

**Confirmed from Next Cycle Focus list:**
- `move_email` handler — `args.targetFolder` passed to `imapService.moveEmail()` without `validateTargetFolder()` (now fixed)
- `bulk_move_emails` handler — same gap (now fixed)
- `send_test_email` handler — `args.to` not validated before SMTP (now fixed)
- `parseEmails` — silently dropped invalid addresses with no log (now fixed)

**Additional audit findings (no new issues):**
- `archive_email`, `move_to_trash`, `move_to_spam` use hardcoded literal strings — no validation needed
- All 4 handlers that accept caller-supplied `targetFolder` now uniformly use `validateTargetFolder()`
- `send_email` delegates validation to smtpService; `send_test_email` now validates at handler level first

### Work Completed This Cycle

1. **`move_email`** — Added `validateTargetFolder(args.targetFolder)` check before `imapService.moveEmail()`. Returns `McpError(InvalidParams)` for `..`, control chars, or oversized strings. (+4 lines)

2. **`bulk_move_emails`** — Added `validateTargetFolder(args.targetFolder)` check before iterating IDs. Fails fast before touching any email. (+3 lines)

3. **`send_test_email`** — Added `isValidEmail(args.to)` check at handler entry. Returns `McpError(InvalidParams, "Invalid recipient email address: <addr>")`. (+3 lines)

4. **`parseEmails` in `src/utils/helpers.ts`** — Imported `logger`. Rewrote filter to a `for` loop that calls `logger.warn(...)` for each dropped invalid address. Callers using CC/BCC paths will now see warnings in logs. (+11 lines, -3 lines)

**Files changed:** `src/index.ts` (+10 lines), `src/utils/helpers.ts` (+17 lines, -5 lines)

### Validation Results

- `npm run build` — PASS (0 TypeScript errors)
- `npm test` — PASS (242/242 tests, 14 test files)

### Git Status

- Commit: `d4a261a`
- Pushed to: `origin/main`

### Next Cycle Focus

**Priority items for Cycle #4:**
1. Add tests for the new `move_email`, `bulk_move_emails`, `send_test_email` handler-level validation (invalid targetFolder / invalid email address inputs)
2. Cursor token HMAC binding — bind cursor JSON to HMAC-SHA256 keyed on a server-startup secret (LOW security impact, medium effort)
3. IMAP reconnect on silent TCP drop — `ensureConnection()` NOOP check (MEDIUM risk, medium effort)
4. `send_test_email` body emoji cleanup (cosmetic, trivial)
5. Review any remaining handlers that receive free-text user input without sanitization

---

## Cycle #4
**Timestamp:** 2026-03-18 00:10–00:15 Eastern
**Git commit:** `8ce8e69`
**Branch:** main
**Model:** claude-sonnet-4-6

### Audit Highlights (new findings this cycle)

No new HIGH/MEDIUM issues found. Confirmed all cycle 1, 2, & 3 fixes still intact.

**Audit areas checked:**
- `src/index.ts` — all folder/email handlers verified using `validateTargetFolder()`, `validateLabelName()`, `validateFolderName()`, or `isValidEmail()` as appropriate. No gaps found.
- `encodeCursor`/`decodeCursor` confirmed present at lines 155–175 of index.ts. Cursor is base64url JSON with field-type validation on decode. HMAC binding remains on the architectural backlog.
- `send_test_email` emoji — confirmed in `smtp-service.ts` (email body), NOT in the tool description. CONTRIBUTING.md rule applies to tool descriptions only, but emoji in email subjects/bodies can cause rendering issues in some clients. Fixed as cosmetic cleanup.
- Handler-level validation for `move_email`, `bulk_move_emails`, `send_test_email` — confirmed correct in index.ts. No unit tests existed for these paths (index.ts cannot be imported in tests due to top-level env-var checks). Tests added to `helpers.test.ts` exercising the exact validation calls the handlers make.

### Work Completed This Cycle

1. **Add 16 unit tests for Cycle #3 handler validation** — Added three `describe` blocks to `src/utils/helpers.test.ts`:
   - `move_email handler validation (validateTargetFolder)` — 6 tests: valid INBOX, valid path with slash, traversal `../../etc`, null-byte injection, oversized string, undefined (omitted) input
   - `bulk_move_emails handler validation (validateTargetFolder)` — 3 tests: valid destination, path traversal `Folders/../INBOX`, control character injection
   - `send_test_email handler validation (isValidEmail)` — 7 tests: valid address, missing domain, missing `@`, null byte, newline (header injection), empty string, local part >64 chars
   (+105 lines in helpers.test.ts)

2. **Remove emoji from `sendTestEmail` body in `src/services/smtp-service.ts`** — Subject changed from `"🧪 Test Email from ProtonMail MCP"` to `"Test Email from ProtonMail MCP"`. H2 and paragraph emoji removed. Plain ASCII text only. (-3 emoji occurrences)

**Files changed:** `src/utils/helpers.test.ts` (+105 lines), `src/services/smtp-service.ts` (3 lines changed)

### Validation Results

- `npm run build` — PASS (0 TypeScript errors)
- `npm test` — PASS (258/258 tests, 14 test files, +16 new tests vs 242 in cycle 3)

### Git Status

- Commit: `8ce8e69`
- Pushed to: `origin/main`

### Next Cycle Focus

**Priority items for Cycle #5:**
1. Cursor token HMAC binding — STILL SKIPPED (medium complexity, low security payoff). Defer until a dedicated cycle.
2. IMAP reconnect / NOOP health check — STILL SKIPPED (medium risk).
3. Review free-text user inputs not yet covered: `search_emails` `from`/`to`/`subject` fields passed to IMAP SEARCH — check whether imapflow sanitizes these or if there is an injection risk.
4. Review `get_email_by_id` / `download_attachment` — `emailId` and `attachmentIndex` args not validated for type/range at handler level before IMAP call.
5. `decodeCursor` — the `parsed.folder` field is accepted as-is without `validateTargetFolder()` check; a crafted cursor could inject a traversal path into the IMAP `getEmails()` call. LOW severity but worth closing.

---

## Cycle #5
**Timestamp:** 2026-03-18 00:30–00:45 Eastern
**Git commit:** `eb6d607`
**Branch:** main
**Model:** claude-sonnet-4-6

### Audit Highlights (new findings this cycle)

No new HIGH/MEDIUM issues found. Confirmed all cycle 1–4 fixes still intact.

**Confirmed from Next Cycle Focus list:**
- `decodeCursor` — `parsed.folder` NOT validated before returning `EmailCursor`. A crafted base64url cursor with `../../etc` as the folder field would be accepted by the type check (`typeof parsed.folder === "string"`) and passed directly to `imapService.getEmails()`. (now fixed)
- `get_email_by_id` handler — `args.emailId` cast as `string` with no non-empty / numeric check. Service's `validateEmailId` throws with an opaque internal error message on bad input. (now fixed with handler-level guard)
- `download_attachment` handler — `args.email_id` has no non-empty check; `args.attachment_index` has no integer/range guard at handler level (service does `Math.trunc` + bounds check, returns null with generic "Attachment not found" for invalid index). (now fixed)

**Additional audit findings:**
- `search_emails` `from`/`to`/`subject` fields — passed to imapflow `search()` criteria object. imapflow encodes IMAP SEARCH criteria via its own serialiser; no string interpolation into raw IMAP commands. Risk is LOW; callers see whatever imapflow produces for odd inputs. No handler-level guard added (imapflow handles this).
- All other handlers reviewed: no additional missing guards found. `cancel_scheduled_email` `args.id` — scheduler returns false for unknown IDs without a guard, but this is benign (no injection risk, friendly error already returned).

### Work Completed This Cycle

1. **`decodeCursor`** — Added `validateTargetFolder(parsed.folder) !== null` check inside `decodeCursor` before returning the cursor. Rejects cursors whose folder field contains `..`, control chars, or exceeds 1000 chars. Returns null (treated as "Invalid or expired cursor" by callers). (+2 lines)

2. **`get_email_by_id`** — Added `!/^\d+$/.test(rawEmailId)` guard at handler entry. Returns `McpError(InvalidParams, "emailId must be a non-empty numeric UID string.")` for empty, non-string, or non-numeric inputs. (+3 lines)

3. **`download_attachment`** — Added `!/^\d+$/.test(rawAttEmailId)` guard on `email_id` and `!Number.isInteger(rawAttIdx) || rawAttIdx < 0` guard on `attachment_index`. Both return `McpError(InvalidParams, ...)` with clear messages. (+6 lines)

**Files changed:** `src/index.ts` (+16 lines, -5 lines)

### Validation Results

- `npm run build` — PASS (0 TypeScript errors)
- `npm test` — PASS (258/258 tests, 14 test files)

### Git Status

- Commit: `eb6d607`
- Pushed to: `origin/main`

### Next Cycle Focus

**Priority items for Cycle #6:**
1. Add unit tests for new `decodeCursor` folder-validation path and `get_email_by_id` / `download_attachment` handler-level guards (similar pattern to Cycle #4 test additions). (~20 tests, LOW risk)
2. `search_emails` `from`/`to`/`subject` — consider adding max-length guards (e.g. 500 chars) to prevent excessively large IMAP SEARCH commands. LOW risk, LOW effort.
3. Cursor token HMAC binding — architectural backlog, defer.
4. IMAP reconnect / NOOP health check — architectural backlog, defer.

## Cycle #7
**Timestamp:** 2026-03-18 01:05–01:15 Eastern
**Git commit:** `714ec11`
**Branch:** main
**Model:** claude-sonnet-4-6

### Audit Highlights (new findings this cycle)

No new HIGH/MEDIUM issues found. Confirmed all cycle 1–6 fixes still intact.

**Confirmed from Next Cycle Focus list:**
- `create_folder` handler — `args.folderName as string` passed directly to IMAP service with no handler-level `validateFolderName()` call. Service's private `validateFolderName()` does protect, but throws a raw `Error` (opaque internal message). (now fixed)
- `delete_folder` handler — same gap as `create_folder`. (now fixed)
- `rename_folder` handler — `args.oldName` and `args.newName` both unguarded at handler level. (now fixed)
- `mark_email_read` / `star_email` handlers — `args.emailId as string` had no numeric UID guard at handler level, unlike `get_email_by_id` (fixed in Cycle #5). Service's private `validateEmailId` throws raw `Error`. (now fixed)

**Additional audit findings (no new issues):**
- `reply_to_email` `inReplyTo` and `references` come from `original.inReplyTo` / `original.references` (fetched from IMAP trusted storage), not user args. SMTP service applies `stripHeaderInjection` on outbound — no additional guard needed.
- `sync_folders` takes no args — no validation needed.
- `save_draft` `inReplyTo`/`references` come from user args but are passed to SMTP service which sanitizes them via `stripHeaderInjection`. No injection risk identified.
- `mark_email_unread` does not exist as a separate case — handled by `mark_email_read` with `isRead: false`.
- `unstar_email` does not exist as a separate case — handled by `star_email` with `isStarred: false`.

**Systematic scan conclusion:** All string args in switch cases that reach IMAP path construction or SMTP now have either handler-level validation or are protected by hardcoded literals / service-layer sanitization. No new gaps found beyond the 5 handlers addressed this cycle.

### Work Completed This Cycle

1. **`create_folder`** — Added `validateFolderName(args.folderName)` check at handler entry. Returns `McpError(InvalidParams)` for empty, slash-containing, traversal, control-char, or oversized names before IMAP call. (+4 lines)

2. **`delete_folder`** — Added identical `validateFolderName(args.folderName)` check. (+3 lines)

3. **`rename_folder`** — Added `validateFolderName(args.oldName)` and `validateFolderName(args.newName)` checks, each prefixing the field name in the error message for clarity. (+5 lines)

4. **`mark_email_read`** — Added `!/^\d+$/.test(merEmailId)` guard matching the existing `get_email_by_id` pattern. Returns `McpError(InvalidParams, "emailId must be a non-empty numeric UID string.")` (+4 lines)

5. **`star_email`** — Same numeric UID guard as `mark_email_read`. (+4 lines)

6. **Add 27 unit tests** — Three new `describe` blocks in `src/utils/helpers.test.ts`:
   - `create_folder / delete_folder handler validation (validateFolderName)` — 12 tests: valid names, empty, whitespace, null, undefined, slash, traversal, null byte, C0 control char, exact-255 boundary, 256 over-limit
   - `rename_folder handler validation (validateFolderName for oldName and newName)` — 5 tests: valid oldName/newName, traversal in oldName, empty newName, slash in newName
   - `mark_email_read / star_email handler validation (numeric emailId guard)` — 10 tests: valid "42", valid "1", empty, alphabetic, mixed, negative, float, null, undefined, null-byte injection
   (+125 lines in helpers.test.ts)

**Files changed:** `src/index.ts` (+20 lines, -2 lines), `src/utils/helpers.test.ts` (+125 lines)

### Validation Results

- `npm run build` — PASS (0 TypeScript errors)
- `npm test` — PASS (314/314 tests, 14 test files, +27 new tests vs 287 in cycle 6)

### Git Status

- Commit: `714ec11`
- Pushed to: `origin/main`

### Next Cycle Focus

**Priority items for Cycle #8:**
1. Remaining `args.X as Y` casts type-check audit — scan all remaining handlers for `as string` / `as number` / `as boolean` casts where the value reaches a service call without a runtime type-check at handler level. Focus on any cast where the JSON schema type is not strictly enforced by the MCP layer.
2. `save_draft` / `schedule_email` — audit `args.attachments as any` — check whether attachment objects (name, content, contentType) are validated or sanitized before IMAP `APPEND`.
3. Cursor token HMAC binding — still deferred (medium effort, low security payoff).
4. IMAP reconnect / NOOP health check — still deferred (medium effort, moderate risk).

## Cycle #6
**Timestamp:** 2026-03-18 00:50–01:00 Eastern
**Git commit:** `403dcaa`
**Branch:** main
**Model:** claude-sonnet-4-6

### Audit Highlights (new findings this cycle)

No new HIGH/MEDIUM issues found. Confirmed all cycle 1–5 fixes still intact.

**Confirmed from Next Cycle Focus list:**
- `decodeCursor` — `validateTargetFolder` guard added in Cycle #5 had no unit tests covering its various rejection paths. (now tested)
- `get_email_by_id` — numeric UID guard from Cycle #5 had no unit tests. (now tested)
- `download_attachment` — `email_id` and `attachment_index` guards from Cycle #5 had no unit tests. (now tested)
- `search_emails` `from`/`to`/`subject` — no length cap at handler level. (now fixed)

**Additional audit items checked:**
- `search_emails` input schema reviewed: `from`, `to`, `subject` are unbound `string` fields with no `maxLength` in schema and no handler-level guard. Length checks added inline. imapflow encodes these safely; the new guard is defence-in-depth only.
- All other handlers reviewed — no additional gaps found.

### Work Completed This Cycle

1. **Add 29 unit tests in `src/utils/helpers.test.ts`** — Three new `describe` blocks:
   - `decodeCursor folder validation (validateTargetFolder)` — 8 tests: valid INBOX, valid path with slash, boundary (1000 chars), traversal `../../etc/passwd`, embedded `Labels/../INBOX`, null byte, C0 control char, over-limit (1001 chars)
   - `get_email_by_id handler validation (numeric UID guard)` — 10 tests: valid "12345", valid "1", empty string, "abc", "12a3", "-1", "1.5", null, undefined, null-byte injection
   - `download_attachment handler validation` — 11 tests: email_id valid/empty/non-numeric/null; attachment_index valid 0/valid 3/negative/-1/float 1.5/NaN/string "0"/undefined
   (+179 lines in helpers.test.ts)

2. **`search_emails` max-length guards** — Added `MAX_SEARCH_TEXT = 500` constant and three length checks (for `from`, `to`, `subject`) at handler entry in `src/index.ts`. Returns `McpError(InvalidParams)` with a clear message for each. (+12 lines)

**Files changed:** `src/utils/helpers.test.ts` (+179 lines), `src/index.ts` (+12 lines)

### Validation Results

- `npm run build` — PASS (0 TypeScript errors)
- `npm test` — PASS (287/287 tests, 14 test files, +29 new tests vs 258 in cycle 5)

### Git Status

- Commit: `403dcaa`
- Pushed to: `origin/main`

### Next Cycle Focus

**Priority items for Cycle #7:**
1. Cursor token HMAC binding — architectural backlog, still deferred (medium effort, low security payoff since cursors are ephemeral paginated tokens).
2. IMAP reconnect / NOOP health check — architectural backlog, still deferred (medium effort, moderate risk).
3. Review remaining any-typed `args` casts in handlers — identify whether any args are passed to services without a runtime type-check (find patterns like `args.X as Y` where Y is a complex type or object).
4. `create_folder` / `rename_folder` — `folderName` / `newName` args: check whether `validateFolderName()` (or equivalent) is called before passing to IMAP service.
