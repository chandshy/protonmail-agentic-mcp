## [Unreleased] — Autonomous Improvement Cycles #1–#41 (2026-03-18)

### Security

- **`body` JSON parsers in settings server** typed as `Record<string, unknown>` instead of `any`; `permissions.preset` now validated against `PERMISSION_PRESETS` before assignment; credential spreads require `typeof === "string"` guard (Cycle #41)
- **IMAP search boolean flags** — `isStarred: false` was previously a no-op (unanswered/undraft fields silently ignored by imapflow); fixed to use `SearchObject` boolean API — `seen`/`answered`/`draft` now correctly pass `false` as "not set" (Cycle #40, bug fix)
- **`search_emails` multi-folder `folders[]`** — each entry now validated via `validateTargetFolder()` to prevent path traversal; service-level `validateFolderName()` also now checks for `..` sequences as defence-in-depth (Cycle #22)
- **`cancel_scheduled_email`** — UUID format guard added; non-UUID `id` values now return `McpError(InvalidParams)` (Cycle #22)
- **Settings UI HTML response** — added `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, and `Cache-Control` headers (Cycle #22)
- **`send_email` / `forward_email` / `reply_to_email`** — missing empty-string guard on required string fields added; empty `to`, `body` now return `McpError(InvalidParams)` instead of propagating to SMTP (Cycles #23–#24)
- **Bulk operations** — empty `emailIds` array now rejected with `McpError(InvalidParams)` rather than silently returning zero-result success (Cycle #23)
- **`saveDraft` `inReplyTo`** CRLF/NUL stripping added to IMAP path — previously only stripped in SMTP path; crafted `inReplyTo` values with `\r\n` could inject MIME headers (Cycle #28)
- **`forward_email` subject** capped at 998 chars (RFC 2822) matching all other send handlers (Cycle #29)
- **`rename_folder`** — same-name guard added; identical old/new name now returns `McpError(InvalidParams)` instead of issuing a spurious IMAP RENAME (Cycle #29)
- **`send_email` / `schedule_email` `replyTo`** validated via `isValidEmail()` at handler entry (Cycle #30)
- **Body max-length cap** (10 MB) added to `send_email`, `save_draft`, `schedule_email`, `reply_to_email`, `forward_email` (Cycles #33–#34)
- **`wipeString()` / `wipeObject()`** in `src/security/memory.ts` typed as `Record<string, unknown>` (was `any`) (Cycle #41)
- **Path traversal prevention** — `get_emails_by_label`, `move_to_folder`, `remove_label`, `bulk_remove_label` now validate label/folder args via `validateLabelName()` / `validateTargetFolder()` before use in IMAP paths (Cycle #1)
- **`decodeCursor` folder field** now validated via `validateTargetFolder()` — crafted cursors with traversal paths (e.g. `../../etc`) are rejected as invalid (Cycle #5)
- **`save_draft` attachment sanitization** — filename stripped of CRLF/NUL and truncated to 255 chars; contentType validated against type/subtype regex before MIME construction (Cycle #9)
- **`validateAttachments()` helper** added to `src/utils/helpers.ts`; called in `send_email`, `save_draft`, and `schedule_email` handlers — malformed attachment arrays now raise `McpError(InvalidParams)` at the handler boundary rather than propagating to nodemailer (Cycle #15)
- **`search_emails` free-text fields** (`from`, `to`, `subject`) capped at 500 characters to prevent oversized IMAP SEARCH commands (Cycle #6)
- **`move_email` / `bulk_move_emails`** now call `validateTargetFolder()` before IMAP move (Cycle #3)
- **`send_test_email`** validates recipient address via `isValidEmail()` at handler entry (Cycle #3)
- **`create_folder` / `delete_folder` / `rename_folder`** now call `validateFolderName()` at handler entry (Cycle #7)
- **`mark_email_read` / `star_email` / `move_to_label` / `remove_label`** now enforce numeric-only emailId guard (Cycles #7, #9)

### Added

- **`SimpleIMAPService.healthCheck()`** — NOOP-based live connection probe; returns `true`/`false`, never throws (Cycle #13)
- **`imap.healthy` field** in `get_connection_status` response — surfaces the NOOP probe result to agents (Cycle #14)
- **`requireNumericEmailId()` helper** in `src/utils/helpers.ts` — DRY extraction of the numeric-UID guard used across 12+ handlers (Cycle #13)
- **JSDoc coverage** — 14 public methods across `SimpleIMAPService` and `SmtpService` now documented (Cycle #11)
- **`validateAttachments()` helper** with 23 unit tests (Cycle #15)

### Changed

- **Type safety milestone (Cycles #37–#41)** — all `catch (e: any)` blocks replaced with `catch (e: unknown)` across entire codebase; `SearchObject` imported from imapflow replacing hand-rolled `ImapSearchCriteria`; `SendMailOptions` from nodemailer replacing `mailOptions: any`; `ImapBodyNode` interface for bodyStructure traversal; `body: any` JSON parsers in settings server replaced with `Record<string, unknown>`; `wipeString/wipeObject` parameters tightened. Zero `any` catch blocks or avoidable `any` type annotations remain in production source.
- **Parameter type guards** — comprehensive runtime type checks added across all 47 tool handlers for string, number, boolean, array, and enum fields; all guards throw `McpError(InvalidParams)` with actionable messages (Cycles #20–#36)
- **`imapSecure` flag** added to IMAP connection config (Cycle #21, implicit TLS support)
- **Type safety** — 9 avoidable `as any` casts removed from `src/index.ts`, `analytics-service.ts`, and `simple-imap-service.ts`; `AppendResult` local interface introduced to replace `(result as any).uid`; all production `as any` casts eliminated (Cycles #10–#12)
- **`move_to_label` / `bulk_move_to_label`** inline validation replaced with `validateLabelName()` helper calls (Cycle #14)
- **`SchedulerService.pruneHistory()`** added — drops non-pending records older than 30 days and caps list at 1 000 entries on load (Cycle #2)
- **`Analytics.getEmailStats()`** — `Math.min/max(...dates)` spread replaced with `reduce` pattern to avoid stack overflow on large arrays (Cycle #2)
- **`parseEmails()`** now logs a `warn` for each dropped invalid address instead of silently discarding (Cycle #3)
- **`sendTestEmail` body** uses plain ASCII — removed emoji from subject and body (Cycle #4)

### Fixed

- **IMAP `isStarred: false` search** — was silently ignored (imapflow non-existent `unflagged` field); now correctly passes `flagged: false` (Cycle #40)
- **`search_emails` date cross-validation** — `dateFrom > dateTo` now returns `McpError(InvalidParams)` instead of silently returning zero results (Cycle #25)
- **Test suite** — 849 tests pass (was 212 before Cycle #1); +637 tests added across Cycles #1–#41 covering all new validation paths, helpers, and security guards

### Documentation

- **README** — corrected tool count from 45 to 47 in tagline and Full Access preset description (Cycle #16)
- **README MCP Prompts** — expanded from 3-item list to full 5-row table covering all registered prompts: `compose_reply`, `thread_summary`, `find_subscriptions`, `triage_inbox`, `daily_briefing` (Cycle #17)
- **Settings UI** — corrected stale "40 tools" to "47 tools" in two locations within the embedded HTML (preset comparison table and setup wizard card) (Cycle #17)
- **`get_connection_status` outputSchema** — added 6 missing fields: `smtp.lastCheck`, `smtp.insecureTls`, `smtp.error`, `imap.insecureTls`, `settingsConfigured`, `settingsConfigPath` (Cycle #18)
- **`list_scheduled_emails` outputSchema** — added missing `retryCount` field to item properties (Cycle #18)
- **`get_email_analytics` outputSchema** — expanded 4 bare `{type:"object"}` entries (`topSenders`, `topRecipients`, `peakActivityHours`, `attachmentStats`) to full typed schemas matching the `EmailAnalytics` interface (Cycle #19)
- **`get_contacts` outputSchema** — added 4 missing `Contact` interface fields: `name`, `firstInteraction`, `averageResponseTime`, `isFavorite` (Cycle #19)

## [2.1.0] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- **5 new tools** (47 total): `save_draft`, `schedule_email`, `list_scheduled_emails`, `cancel_scheduled_email`, `download_attachment`
- `save_draft` — IMAP APPEND to Drafts folder; returns server-assigned UID
- `schedule_email` — queue email for delivery at a future time (60 s – 30 days); survives restarts
- `list_scheduled_emails` — list all scheduled emails with status and retry count
- `cancel_scheduled_email` — cancel a pending scheduled email by ID
- `download_attachment` — retrieve attachment content as base64 from cached email
- Retry logic for scheduled emails (up to 3 attempts before marking permanently failed)
- `--help` / `--version` flags for `npm run settings` entry point
- `insecureTls` field on `get_connection_status` SMTP and IMAP sub-objects — agents can now detect degraded TLS

### Changed
- `EmailMessage.headers` type widened to `Record<string, string | string[]>` (RFC 5322 multi-value headers)
- `ScheduledEmail` interface gains optional `retryCount` field
- `PERMISSION_PRESETS` is now an exported const in `schema.ts`; `loader.ts` and `security.ts` derive their valid-preset sets from it
- `settings-main.ts` validates `PROTONMAIL_MCP_CONFIG` env var stays within the home directory

### Security
- TLS cert-missing and cert-load-failure paths now log at `error` level (previously `warn`) and set `insecureTls = true` on the service instance — surface via `get_connection_status`
- Escalation `approveEscalation()` now re-checks expiry after finding the record (prevents TOCTOU race)
- Escalation `reason` field now strips ANSI/C0/C1 control codes before storage
- Scheduler `load()` validates each record's shape — malformed entries are skipped with a warning rather than poisoning the in-memory list
- Scheduler `persist()` uses atomic temp-file + rename to prevent partial writes
- Rate-limit denials now logged at `warn` level (previously silent)
- Logger sanitizer updated from `[\r\n\t]` to full C0/C1 range `[\x00-\x1f\x7f]`
- IMAP search strings (`from`, `to`, `subject`) sanitized against `"` and `\` to prevent SEARCH injection
- `dateFrom` / `dateTo` search parameters validated with `isNaN(Date.parse(...))` before use
- `references` items in `saveDraft` stripped of C0/C1 control characters
- Analytics cache now uses an in-flight promise to collapse concurrent stampede fetches
- Redundant per-tool `permissions.check()` calls removed from `save_draft` and `schedule_email` (already enforced centrally)
- Duplicate `'drafts'` entry removed from `pickDraftsFolder` fallback list

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- **40 tools** (up from 20 in v1.0.0) with structured output and MCP annotations
- **Permission system** with 4 presets: read_only (default), supervised, send_only, full

- **Human-gated escalation system** — two-channel design with CSRF protection, 5-minute expiry, audit trail
- **Browser-based settings UI** at localhost:8765 with setup wizard, permissions, escalations, and status tabs
- **Terminal UI (TUI)** with auto-detection of environment capabilities
- **MCP Resources** — `email://` and `folder://` URI schemes for addressable data
- **MCP Prompts** — compose_reply, thread_summary, find_subscriptions workflow templates
- **Cursor-based pagination** for stable pagination across mailbox mutations
- **Progress notifications** for bulk operations (bulk_move, bulk_delete, bulk_move_to_label)
- **Tool annotations** — readOnlyHint, destructiveHint, idempotentHint on all tools

#### New Tools

- All tool responses now include `structuredContent` + `outputSchema`
- Config stored in `~/.protonmail-mcp.json` with mode 0600 and atomic writes
- `add_label` renamed to `move_to_label` for accurate semantics

### Security
- 10-layer defense-in-depth security model
- CSRF protection on all mutating settings API calls
